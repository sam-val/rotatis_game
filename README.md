# Rotatis

I wanted to play around with rotation, hence this little game. It swears at you when being given a wrong answer. Mwahahaha.

## How to:

0. Install Python3.7 (or above)

1. Install the required modules using pip, run this at the root folder:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run game.py


## Gameplay:
You're asked to guess the shape of the board after it is spun (randomly by the conputer). There're **5 levels**.

#### The computer can move the board in four ways:

## Gif:

<img src="images/preview.gif" width = 700/>

### For packaging for your OS:

```
pyinstaller -D game.py -n rotatis --distpath {your distpath} --add-data images:./images --add-data screenshots:screenshots --add-data text:text --collect-submodules PIL

```
